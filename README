#What is this
I made this in college to automate what I used to do for each of my Skyrim characters, which is give them shoutable, three-syllable dragon names. Using Thuum.org, excel and notepad, I made a parsable dictionary file to be read by a program. Python was chosen for ease of use.
It's text based, but it gets the job done.

#How do I use it?
Run it as you would any python program: python dragon-name-generator.py

Happy shouting!
